          Welcome to my webpage! My name is Edgar, and I am a founding engineer at the YCombinator startup ProsperAI.
          </p>
          <p> Previously, I was a <a href="https://becarios.fundacionlacaixa.org/en/fellows">La Caixa Fellow 2023</a>, which allowed me to complete Part III (MASt in Pure Mathematics) at the University of Cambridge during the academic year 2023-2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated in Maths and Computer Science at <a href="https://www.upc.edu/en">UPC</a> (Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya) in Barcelona. My undergraduate studies were sponsored by <a href="https://cfis.upc.edu/en">CFIS-UPC</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the academic year 2022-2023, I visited <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/">Prof. MohammadTaghi</a> for my final degree project at the <a href="https://umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Academically, I am interested in areas at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, including Game Theory, Combinatorics, Theory of Computation, and beyond. I also like the applications to social sciences and economics.
        </p>
        <p>
        But at the moment I want to hack and see what exciting products I can contribute to.
        </p>

      <p>
        I love solving problems (and creating them), teaching, sci-fi and mountain sports.
